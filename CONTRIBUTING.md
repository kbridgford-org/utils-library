# Contributing to Octocademy Utils Library

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Octocademy Utils Library! We value your contributions and want to make the process as easy as possible. Here are the steps to get you started:

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine to start making changes.
3. **Using GitHub Codespaces**: For a seamless setup, we recommend using GitHub Codespaces. It allows you to code directly in your browser without having to install anything on your local machine.
   - Navigate to your fork on GitHub and click the "Code" button, then select "Open with Codespaces".
   - GitHub Codespaces automatically configures your development environment based on the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in the repository. This ensures that you have all the necessary tools and extensions installed.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a New Branch**: Always create a new branch for your changes. This keeps the main branch clean and simplifies the review process.
2. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, additions, or fixes. Be sure to follow the coding standards and guidelines of the project.
3. **Test Your Changes**: Run the existing tests and add new ones if necessary. Ensure that all tests pass.

## Submitting Your Changes

1. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
2. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
3. **Open a Pull Request**: From your fork, open a pull request to the main repository. Provide a clear description of the changes and any other relevant information.

## After Your Pull Request is Merged

Once your pull request is merged, your changes will be part of the Octocademy Utils Library. We encourage you to continue contributing and becoming an active member of our community.
